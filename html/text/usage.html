            <h1 class="title">Using These Songs</h1>
            <p class="intro">There are many ways to play these songs; use them in a way which makes sense for you and your students. In my studio we             use them as solo repertoire while also working through a published piano method.</p>
            
            <h2 class="graph-head">Teaching Sequence</h2>
            <p class="intro">I use the following steps to teach the songs.  Feel free to skip steps or add some more.  There is no "right" way.</p>
            
            <h3 class="graph-subhead">Melody</h3>
            <ul class="one-indent"> 
                <li class="bullets">Play the melody as written with the right hand by itself and the left hand by itself.</li>
                <li class="bullets">Play the melody as written with both hands at the same time.</li>
                <li class="bullets">If the melody is written for the white keys, play it on the black keys and vice versa.</li>
                <li class="bullets">Play the melody with a combination of black and white keys. You establish the combinations</li>
                <li class="bullets">Play the melody anywhere on the keyboard the student chooses. (This leads to some interesting polytonality!)</li>
            </ul>
                    
            <h3 class="graph-subhead">Chords</h3>
            <ul class="one-indent">
                <li class="bullets">Learn the chords by themselves with both hands.</li>
                <li class="bullets">Play the melody with the right hand and the chords with the left.</li>
                <li class="bullets">Play the melody with left hand and the chords with the right.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="graph-head">Unit Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3 class="graph-subhead">3 Note Songs</h3>
            <p class="one-indent">Use only the pitches do, re and mi.  All songs are in major and there are some in duple meter and some in triple.              I let students use any finger they want, as long as each finger plays only one key.</p>

            <h3 class="graph-subhead">4 Note Songs</h3>
            <p class="one-indent">Use the pitches do, re, mi and sol.  All songs are in major and there are some in duple meter and some in triple.              Playing with standard fingering is required and finger numbers are included in the notation. </p>

            <h3 class="graph-subhead">Diatonic Songs</h3>
            <p class="one-indent">These are easier to play than the pentatonic songs as they are in 5-finger position without any stretches.  All songs                are in major and there are some in duple meter and some in triple. Standard rhythm notation is added.</p>

            <h3 class="graph-subhead">Penatonic Songs</h3>
            <p class="one-indent">These songs use an extended hand position which skips the note fa.  All songs are in major and there are some in duple               meter and some in triple. Time signatures are added to the notation.</p>

            <h2 class="graph-head"> Repertoire Considerations</h2>
            
            <h3 class="graph-subhead">Copyright</h3>
            <p class="one-indent">This collection contains only folksongs due to copyright restrictions. I cannot afford to pay the licensing fees                         necessary to publish songs outside the public domain. While I have traced the history and background of each song to the best of my ability,                   I am human and therefore make mistakes. If you think I have inadvertently included a copyrighted piece, please contact me!</p>
            
            <h3 class="graph-subhead">Subject Matter</h3>
            <p class="one-indent">As folksongs from earlier times, there may contain lyrics which do not fit the sensibilities and                                         sensitivities of some folk. You are welcome to not use songs which you do not like, that is your perogative. However, as a deep believer in                    diversity of thought, I will not remove songs from this site unless there is a verifiable copyright claim.</p>

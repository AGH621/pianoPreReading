# Piano Pre-Reading Book
## Deployment
Currently I'm using GitHub Pages: <a href="https://agh621.github.io/pianoPreReading/" target="_blank">Piano PreReading Book</a>

## Purpose
This project serves two purposes.
1. It is a portfolio project to demonstrate my web development skills and document what I've learned.  It will become more sophisticated as I get better at this.
2. It is a digital version of a piano book that I wrote many year ago, and still use in my music studio today.

## Progress
August 2022 - Redesigned and rebuilt the site to utilize MUI library.

July 2022 - Started using React to render site pages. Discovered Material UI (MUI) and decided to adopt it.

June 2022 - Designed and implemented some basic interactivity via JavaScript.
1. Switch the notation between black and white keys
2. Display chord notation instead of melody

Started work on generating new pages automatically from an XML or musicXML file.  This feature is using Python and its Music21 library to determine whether a song should be included here and to extract music information from them.  My collaborator, Jim K, is doing the coding for these parts.  I am learning React, which will be used to do the page rendering.

May 2022 - Streamlined and improved the CSS.  Improved this README with basic Markdown.

April 2022 - Launched Version 2.0 replacing the old, paper-based version dating from 2013. It is basic, hand-written, hand-designed HTML/CSS.

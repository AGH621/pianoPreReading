# Piano Pre-Reading Book
## Deployment
Currently I'm using GitHub Pages: <a href="https://agh621.github.io/pianoPreReading/" target="_blank">Piano PreReading Book</a>

## Purpose
This project serves two purposes.
1. It is a portfolio project to demonstrate my web development skills and document what I've learned.  It will become more sophisticated as I get better at this.
2. It is a digital version of a piano book that I wrote many year ago, and still use in my music studio today.

## Progress
December 2022 - Launched on Version 3.0 GitHub Pages.

November 2022 - Proofreading and minor appearance changes.

October 2022 - Consulted with Madeline Tzifas (a visual arts student) on the color palette and adopted her suggestions.  Finalized the site theme.

September 2022 - Continued working on MUI components. Wrote text of home, about, takadimi, and unit pages. Changed the color palette of the keyboard diagrams.

August 2022 - Discovered Material UI (MUI) and decided to adopt it. Redesigned and rebuilt the site to utilize MUI library.

July 2022 - Started using React to render site pages. Figured out how to create radio buttons for the song variations.  Attempted to add finger numbers for each song and the ability to change them based on the song variation being displayed. Put the feature on hiatus due to its complexity.

Front End
  Designed and implemented some basic interactivity via JavaScript.
    1. Switch the notation between black and white keys
    2. Display chord notation instead of melody
    3. Start learning React, which will be used to do the page rendering.

Back End
  1. Verson 1 of score filters
  2. key signature
  3. ScoreDef*
  4. solf√®ge translation

### _May 2022_ 
Streamlined and improved the CSS.  Improved this README with basic Markdown.

Started work on generating new pages automatically from an XML or musicXML file.  This feature is using Python and its Music21 library to determine whether a song should be included here and to extract music information from them.  My collaborator, Jim K, is doing the coding for these parts.  

### _April 2022_
Launched Version 2.0 replacing the old, paper-based version dating from 2013. It is basic, hand-written, hand-designed HTML/CSS.

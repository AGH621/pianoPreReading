# pianoPreReading
## Purpose
This project serves two purposes.
1. It is a portfolio project to demonstrate my web development skills and document what I've learned.  It will become more sophisticated as I acquire more skills and knowledge.
2. It is a digital version of a piano book that I wrote many year ago, but still use in my music studio.

##Progress
April 2022 - Launched Version 2.0 replacing the old, paper-based version dating from 2013. It is basic, hand-written, hand-designed HTML/CSS.

May 2022 - Streamlined and improved the CSS

# pianoPreReading
## Deployment
Currently I'm using GitHub Pages: <a href="https://agh621.github.io/pianoPreReading/" target="_blank">Piano PreReading Book</a>

## Purpose
This project serves two purposes.
1. It is a portfolio project to demonstrate my web development skills and document what I've learned.  It will become more sophisticated as I get better at this.
2. It is a digital version of a piano book that I wrote many year ago, and still use in my music studio today.

## Progress
June 2022 - Designing and implementing interactivity via JavaScript.  Intending to add buttons to: 
1. Switch the notation between black and white keys
2. Display the chord notation
3. Generate new pages automatically from an XML or musicXML file

May 2022 - Streamlined and improved the CSS.  Improved this README with basic Markdown.

April 2022 - Launched Version 2.0 replacing the old, paper-based version dating from 2013. It is basic, hand-written, hand-designed HTML/CSS.

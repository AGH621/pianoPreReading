Converting Scores Automatically

1) Should this score be converted?
    Analyze the score with Music21 to answer the question.  Use these criteria:
    	a. number of parts = 1
        
    	b. range
    		i. min = Major 3rd
    		ii. max = Major 6th
                1) reject all scores containing the note "fa" [will require translating the note names to solfege]
                
    	c. time signature: top number must be divisible by 2 or 3
        
    	d. rhythm
    		i. if c = 2 but not 3: one or the other below must be true
    			1) piece contains ONLY: eighth, quarter, half notes
    			2) piece contains ONLY: quarter, half, whole notes
    		ii. if c = 3: piece contains ONLY: eighth, quarter, dotted quarter, dotted half notes


2) If answer to #1 is "yes": Capture song data to enter into DB
		a. title

			i. duple = top number of time signature divisible by 2 but not 3
			ii. triple = top number of time signature divisible by 3 
		c. range

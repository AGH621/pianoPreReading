This is actually PreReading Piano Book 2.0.  Version 1.0 was created in 2013 when I grew frustrated with the piano method book series I use with young students.  All students, especially the young ones, want to play songs, and can tell the difference between real ones, and those written as exercises in piano method books.  Problem is, these young students cannot read standard music notation yet.  So, I transcribed some 3-note folksongs commonly sung in elementary music classes into graphic notation.  The key to be played is colored and the arrows show long a key should be depressed.  I ended up with 12 songs: 6 in duple meter, 6 in triple meter.  Soon I made a set of 4-note songs, then pentatonic, then diatonic.  Each set adding elements of standard notation.  Even though they were printed on 11x17 paper and unweildly, my students loved them!

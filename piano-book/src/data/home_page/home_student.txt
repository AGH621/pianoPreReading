There is no substitute for a piano teacher who can listen and watch your child play, and tailor instruction to them.  For this reason I recommend using this book in junction with live lessons. Support your child by listening to them practice, while following along with the symbolic notation of the songs. You might want to play the songs along with your child or have them teach you how to play!

It is possible to use this book without a teacher. Be sure to read each unit page carefully, making sure you understand what is to be learned before working with your child.  Also read the "For Teachers" sections to pick up any hints and tricks for teaching the material.  Play through the songs you intend your child to learn, making sure you can play them yourself before assigning them.

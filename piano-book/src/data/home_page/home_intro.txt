Welcome to my digital piano book!

This book is specifically for those who want to play songs, but have not yet begun to read standard notation. It is intended for young children, ages 5-7, who are working on the primer level of any standard piano curriculum.  In addition to playing melodies, children can easily harmonize these songs with the primary chords (tonic, dominant, and subdominant), allowing for an early experience playing from a lead sheet!

Traditionally there is a gap in piano pedagogy between when a young child starts to learn piano and when he/she knows enough music notation to play real songs.  It can be a frustrating time for the student (and their parents) because he/she wants to play real music, but has not acquired the skills to do so.  The purpose of this book is to fill this gap.  By using pictoral notation (showing which notes to press with colored keys) and songs with an extremely limited ranged, even students in their first week of lessons can play authentic melodies successfully.
